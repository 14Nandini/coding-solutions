# Set Mismatch

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

You have a set of integers `s`, which originally contains all the numbers from `1` to `n`. Unfortunately, due to some error, one of the numbers in `s` got duplicated to another number in the set, which results in  **repetition of one**  number and  **loss of another**  number.

You are given an integer array `nums` representing the data status of this set after the error.

Find the number that occurs twice and the number that is missing and return  *them in the form of an array*.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: nums = [1,2,2,4]
Output: [2,3]

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: nums = [1,1]
Output: [1,2]

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 2 <= nums.length <= 104
- 1 <= nums[i] <= 104

    public int[] findErrorNums(int[] nums) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> hm = new HashMap<>();
        int[] res = new int[2];
        for(int num : nums){
            hm.put(num, hm.getOrDefault(num, 0)+1);
        }
        for(int i = 1; i <= nums.length; i++){
            if(!hm.containsKey(i)) res[1] = i;
            else if(hm.get(i) > 1) res[0] = i;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
