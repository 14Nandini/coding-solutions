# Count Group Occurrences

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given a string  **s**  and an integer  **k**, count the number of distinct characters that appear in exactly  **k groups**  in the string.

A group is defined as one or more consecutive occurrences of the same character. For example, in the string "aaabbcca", the groups are "aaa", "bb", "cc" and "a".

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: s = "abc", k = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: The characters 'a', 'b' and 'c' each appear in exactly one group.
```

```
Input: s = "geeksforgeeks", k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: The characters 'g', 'e', 'k' and 's' each appear in exactly two groups.
```

```
Input: s = "aaaaa", k = 2
Output: 0
Explanation: The character 'a' appears in only one group, so no character appears in exactly two groups.
```

```java
class Solution {
	int getCount(String S, int N) {
		HashMap<Character, Integer> hm = new HashMap<>();
		int i = 0;
		while (i < S.length()) {
			char ch = S.charAt(i);
			int j = i;
			while (j < S.length() && S.charAt(j) == ch)
				j++;
			hm.put(ch, hm.getOrDefault(ch, 0) + 1);
			i = j;
		}
		int c = 0;
		for (int val : hm.values()) {
			if (val == N)
				c++;
		}
		return c;
	}
}

```
