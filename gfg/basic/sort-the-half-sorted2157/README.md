# Sort Two Parts  Sorted

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Basic-red)

## Problem

Given an integer array where the two parts around a break point are individually sorted, merge them into a single sorted array.  The break point can be anywhere in the array, including at the beginning or end.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 8, -1, 7, 10]
Output: [-1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 10] 
Explanation: [2, 3, 8] and [-1, 7, 10] are sorted in the original array. The overall sorted version is [-1 2 3 7 8 10]
```

```
Input: arr[] = [-4, 6, 9, -1, 3]
Output: [-4, -1, 3, 6, 9]
Explanation: [-4, 6, 9] and [-1, 3] are sorted in the original array. The overall sorted version is [-4 -1 3 6 9]
```

```
Input: arr[] = [10, 20, 30]
Output: [10, 20, 30]
Explanation: One part is empty and the other part is whole array which is already sorted.
```
